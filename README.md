<h3>Description</h3>
Hatching the Beast is a 2D Endless Runner game mixed with some elements of RPGs (Character creation and customization, loot collection, story…) and platforming. It was developed using Godot 4 / GDScript.<br/>
A side-on perspective, typical of platforming games, has been chosen. As in every endless runner game, the main actor moves moves forward automatically and the player controls jumping to avoid obstacles and enemies.<br/>
In this game, the protagonist carries a large egg in their hands. The more the player advances, the more the egg will mature, and the better the hatched creature will be. It’s up to the player to choose the moment to stop and hatch the egg to. obtain his creature and end the game. However, if the player collides with an obstacle without having hatched the egg, it will be destroyed, and all the progress made up to that point will have been in vain.
